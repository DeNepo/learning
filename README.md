# Effective Learning

Of all the skills you will need as a developer __effective learning__ is the most important.  There is no library, no framework, no buzzword you can master that will serve you better than strong study and learning habits.

Fortunately studying and learning are skills you can improve.  Keeping an organized study journal is the first step.
